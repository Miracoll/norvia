								Important Risk Warning
							</div>
							<p>Copy trading involves substantial risk of loss. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Only invest funds you can afford to lose. Cryptocurrency and forex trading are highly volatile and may not be suitable for all investors.</p>
						</div>

						<!-- Section 1 -->
						<div class="agreement-section">
							<h2 class="section-title">1. Agreement Overview</h2>
							<div class="section-content">
								<p>This Copy Trading Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into between you ("User," "Copier," or "you") and Norvia.io ("Platform," "we," or "us"). By using the copy trading service, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by all terms and conditions outlined in this Agreement.</p>
								<p>Copy trading allows you to automatically replicate trades executed by other traders ("Providers" or "Signal Providers") on our platform. While this service can be convenient, it carries significant financial risks that you must fully understand before participating.</p>
							</div>
						</div>

						<!-- Section 2 -->
						<div class="agreement-section">
							<h2 class="section-title">2. Eligibility and Account Requirements</h2>
							<div class="section-content">
								<p>To use the copy trading service, you must:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Be at least 18 years of age or the legal age of majority in your jurisdiction</li>
									<li>Have completed identity verification (KYC) as required by the platform</li>
									<li>Maintain sufficient funds in your trading account to support copied positions</li>
									<li>Be legally permitted to engage in trading activities in your country of residence</li>
									<li>Not be a resident of any restricted or prohibited jurisdiction</li>
									<li>Accept all risks associated with leveraged trading and cryptocurrency markets</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
						</div>

						<!-- Section 3 -->
						<div class="agreement-section">
							<h2 class="section-title">3. How Copy Trading Works</h2>
							<div class="section-content">
								<p><strong>Starting to Copy:</strong> When you allocate funds to copy a Signal Provider, all new trades executed by that Provider will be automatically replicated in your account proportionally based on your allocated amount.</p>
								<p><strong>Trade Execution:</strong> Copied trades will be executed in your account as soon as technically possible after the Provider opens a position. Due to market conditions, network latency, and liquidity factors, your execution prices may differ from the Provider's prices.</p>
								<p><strong>Position Management:</strong> Existing open positions held by the Provider before you start copying will NOT be copied to your account. Only new positions opened after you initiate the copy relationship will be replicated.</p>
								<p><strong>Stopping Copy Trading:</strong> You may discontinue copying a Provider at any time. However, positions already opened in your account will remain active and must be managed or closed manually, or will close automatically when the Provider closes their corresponding positions.</p>
							</div>
						</div>

						<!-- Section 4 -->
						<div class="agreement-section">
							<h2 class="section-title">4. Fees and Charges</h2>
							<div class="section-content">
								<p>The following fees apply to copy trading activities:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Performance Fee:</strong> Signal Providers may charge a performance fee (typically 10-30%) calculated on net profits generated in your account. This fee is only charged when you close positions with a profit.</li>
									<li><strong>Trading Commissions:</strong> Standard trading commissions and spreads apply to all copied trades as per the platform's fee schedule.</li>
									<li><strong>Overnight Financing:</strong> Swap fees or rollover charges may apply to positions held overnight, depending on the asset class and market conditions.</li>
									<li><strong>Subscription Fees:</strong> Some Premium Signal Providers may require a monthly or quarterly subscription fee, which will be clearly disclosed before you start copying.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>All fees are automatically calculated and deducted from your account. You can view detailed fee breakdowns in your account statements and transaction history.</p>
							</div>
						</div>

						<!-- Section 5 -->
						<div class="agreement-section">
							<h2 class="section-title">5. Risk Disclosure and Acknowledgment</h2>
							<div class="section-content">
								<p>You explicitly acknowledge and accept the following risks:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Market Risk:</strong> Cryptocurrency and forex markets are extremely volatile. Prices can move dramatically in short periods, resulting in substantial gains or losses.</li>
									<li><strong>Leverage Risk:</strong> Leveraged trading amplifies both profits and losses. You can lose more than your initial investment if positions move against you.</li>
									<li><strong>Provider Performance Risk:</strong> Past performance of a Signal Provider is not indicative of future results. Profitable traders can experience losses, and losing traders may continue to lose.</li>
									<li><strong>Execution Risk:</strong> Your trades may execute at different prices than the Provider's trades due to slippage, liquidity constraints, market volatility, or technical delays.</li>
									<li><strong>Margin Call Risk:</strong> If your account equity falls below required margin levels, your positions may be automatically liquidated, resulting in realized losses.</li>
									<li><strong>Technical Risk:</strong> System failures, internet connectivity issues, server downtime, or software bugs may prevent trades from being copied or executed properly.</li>
									<li><strong>Currency Risk:</strong> If you trade assets denominated in different currencies, exchange rate fluctuations may affect your returns.</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
