                                    <h3>What is a Cryptocurrency?</h3>
                                    <p>A cryptocurrency like bitcoin is a virtual currency traded peer-to-peer on a
                                        blockchain, independent of centralized authorities like banks and governments.
                                        Cryptocurrencies are entirely virtual, so they are not backed by physical
                                        commodities and have no intrinsic value.</p>
                                </div>

                                <div class="section">
                                    <h3>How Do Cryptocurrencies Work?</h3>
                                    <p>Primarily, cryptocurrencies rely on blockchain technology to complete a
                                        transaction via an intricate P2P network. Once a transfer request is entered
                                        into the network, it is validated by the network and added to a pool of other
                                        transactions to create a block of data for the ledger, which is then entered
                                        into the existing blockchain. Once the block is successfully added to the chain,
                                        the transaction is approved and completed.</p>
                                </div>

                                    <h3>Investment Opportunities with Cryptocurrencies</h3>
                                    <p>Absolutely. Cryptocurrencies have become established investment commodities among
                                        major financial institutions and have even been adopted by countries such as
                                        Australia and Japan. As with any investment though, there are risks linked to
                                        market movements, high volatility and economics.</p>

                                    <p>Leverage can amplify both gains and losses</p>
                                    <p>Cryptocurrency regulations continue to evolve</p>
                                    <p>Always trade with funds you can afford to lose</p>
                                    <p>Consider diversifying your investment portfolio</p>
