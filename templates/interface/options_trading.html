                                    <h2>Binary Options Trading</h2>
                                    <p>One of the newest and most popular derivatives currently offered in the world of
                                        currency trading is the binary option. Binary options are simple to trade and
                                        limit the risk of the trader's investment to the amount of money paid to
                                        purchase the option. Today, more and more people are engaging in binary options
                                        trading because it deals directly with the financial markets and offers high
                                        returns. There are a number of advantages that binary options trading offers
                                        people who engage in it. The biggest draw is that it is very simple and offers
                                        large rewards.</p>

                                    <h3>Simplicity of Trading</h3>
                                    <p>Trading in binary options is very simple and easy. The trading process itself is
                                        a piece of cake. All you have to do is make a prediction on whether the asset
                                        will go up or nosedive. The next step is to enter the amount you want to spend
                                        on that trade and hit Send. Now all you have to do is track the trade.</p>

                                    <h3>Low Investment Threshold</h3>
                                    <p>The best thing about binary options trading is that you do not necessarily have
                                        to bet high. You can start off with low investments till you get the hang of it.
                                        And even once you are good at it, you can continue to bet small. The returns may
                                        not be as high as if you bet big, but they are sufficient to get you to
                                        continue.</p>
                                </div>

                                    <h3>Controlled Risk</h3>
                                    <p>Because you can engage in binary trading with the least amount of money, the
                                        risks are also limited. Effectively, the degree of risk is for you to decide:
                                        you could go in with minimal risk or jump in with a big element of risk. One
                                        thing that works for you is that you know how much you will win or lose based on
                                        the amount you are betting or investing. This allows you to pick the amount and
                                        limit the amount of risk you expose yourself to. You take a calculated risk, and
                                        that can translate to big reward if all goes well.</p>

                                    <h3>Short Timeframes and High Returns</h3>
                                    <p>One area where binary options trading differs from the standard financial trading
                                        is in the amount of time a trade is valid for; the expire timeframes are shorter
                                        in this form of trading. Adding to this short time frame is the stupendously
                                        high returns involved with some trades; the returns could be as high as 90% if
                                        all goes well and luck is on your side. So imagine a trade that takes all of 15
                                        minutes and gets you a return of 80%-90% - that is financial profit heaven. You
                                        trade quick, trade safe, and get good returns.</p>

                                    <h3>Market Independence</h3>
                                    <p>The best thing about binary options trading is that the fact of your winning is
                                        not dependent on prevalent marketing conditions. You can win regardless of
                                        whether the price of the asset you have put your money on is rising or falling.
                                        All you need to do is be aware of the different strategies that you can adopt.
                                        Adopting the right strategies can lead to you winning way more than what you
                                        ordinarily would have. Another way of maximizing wins is to track the financial
                                        markets; this allows you to be aware of when the prices are climbing skywards so
                                        you can sell and make your profits.</p>
